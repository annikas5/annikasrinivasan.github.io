Mentoring is something I am very passionate about! As a minority female I personally know the importance of mentorship to help advance students exerrience within Robotics. Therefore, I enjoy working through different organizations to network and mentor students within my field. 


### Mentor â€” CMU School of Computer Science Mentorship Program
- I mentor a group of bright and hard working young women at CMU in Computer Sceince. We meet throughout the semester to discuss how everyones research and classes are going. We discuss how I can support them in classes, navigating their research and general networking.

### Coding Instructor - Girls Who Code 
- During my undergrad I was an instrcutor for the GWC organization which provided weekly free coding classes to middle school & highschool girls. I developed ciriculums to teach C++, python and arduino coding. I also helped to created an empowering and fun enviroment for students to learn and excel in CS and Robotics!
