## Computation of Human Centroidal Dynamics 
### RoboDesign Lab

I am using human-machine-interface (HMI) data to compute a reduced-ordered model, specifically the centroidal dynamics model, in real-time for a human pilot. This model will be used to investigate human motion and balancing strategies to inspire robot control.

##  HOPPY Simulation
### RoboDesign Lab

I applied robot dynamics and controls principles, including finite-state machines, Jacobians, and trajectory planning, to begin creating an accurate dynamic model of HOPPY, a robot that jumps around a fixed gantry. I employed the software program MuJoCo to simulate the model and HOPPY’s movement within the gantry environment.

## Medical Training Arm Simulator
### The Human Dynamics and Controls Lab

Rigidity is a movement disorder that is characterized by an abnormal increase in muscle tone (which is the stiffness or resistance to movement of a muscle). This condition, which is often seen in patients with Parkinson's disease, may interfere with one's movement and can result in some pain or discomfort.

To evaluate rigidity, clinicians move their patients arm up and down, extending/stretching it, to determine whether the stiffness/resistance is abnormal or not (as shown in the video).

This process, however, is subjective and depends on a clinician's experience. Additionally, when medical students are learning about this condition, along with being told its definition, they may get to conduct the evaluation assessment themselves on patients experiencing rigidity. As explained previously, though, this may cause patients pain and students may repeat the evaluation several times to ensure they are doing it correctly, possibly harming the patient more. In hopes of standardizing this procedure and also avoiding causing pain to patients through this assessment that may feel invasive to them, the arm trainer team at HDCL is creating a robotic simulator that would mimic different levels of rigidity, as well as other neurological behaviors, to help medical students and other healthcare trainees practice and improve their clinical techniques. Other behaviors include spasticity (which is similar to rigidity, but is dependent on the stretch velocity) and cogwheel rigidity (which is another type of rigidity but deals with tremors). 

My primary role on the arm trainer team was to revise the existing shroud CAD (the shroud are the 3D printed parts surrounding the arm trainer). You can see the CAD in the picture. I found that the previous design was not secure enough and assembly/disassembly was difficult. It required several bolts for installation and having to drill and tap holes in areas that were very thin and not sturdy enough to hold all the shroud together. My goal was to optimize the number of connections and fasteners to facilitate manufacturing and assembly. I used SolidWorks when revising the CAD, doing multiple iterations, and 3D printing (used Cura) low percentage prototypes to evaluate their efficacy, ultimately doing final prints of the shroud for the arm trainer/simulator, as seen in the photo.

The next step is to conduct the study, gathering clinicians and seeing how accurate the trainer is.

## Work on Accessible Technology


### I'm ok because I'm alive" understanding socio-cultural accessibility barriers for refugees with disabilities in the US

I wanted to understand the perspectives of refugees with disabilities on social-cultural barriers that effect their access to medical care.  With this goal, I interviewed community leaders that worked directly with refugees to gain insight on these barrier. I conducted thematic analysis to extract themes on barriers that prevent refugees from accessing the care they need.

### Structural accessibility barriers and service gaps facing refugees with disabilities in the United States

I wanted to understand the perspectives of refugees with disabilities on service-gaps (especially between refugees and healthcare providers) that effect their access to medical care.  With this goal, I interviewed community leaders that worked directly with refugees to gain insight on these barrier. I conducted thematic analysis to extract themes on barriers that prevent refugees from accessing the care they need.

### Fear is Grounded in Reality”: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Refugees’ Access to Health and Accessibility Resources in the United States

With the hardships that hit the US with COVID-19, I wanted to understand the perspectives of refugees with disabilities on the effects of COVID-19 on their access to medical care.  With this goal, I interviewed community leaders that worked directly with refugees to gain insight on these barrier. I conducted thematic analysis to extract themes on barriers that prevent refugees from accessing the care they need during COVID-19.

## 3D Modeling 

### Three-dimensional Visualization of Harvestman Spermathecae using Confocal Microscopy

I used confocal microscopy to develop a non-invasive imaging and 3D-reconstruction method for the sperm storage organ of female arachnids; I developed the first-ever noninvasive imaging method for arachnids and created the first 3D images of their sperm storage organs.
