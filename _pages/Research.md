## Computation of Human Centroidal Dynamics 
### RoboDesign Lab

I am using human-machine-interface (HMI) data to compute a reduced-ordered model, specifically the centroidal dynamics model, in real-time for a human pilot. This model will be used to investigate human motion and balancing strategies to inspire robot control.

##  HOPPY Simulation
### RoboDesign Lab

I applied robot dynamics and controls principles, including finite-state machines, Jacobians, and trajectory planning, to begin creating an accurate dynamic model of HOPPY, a robot that jumps around a fixed gantry. I employed the software program MuJoCo to simulate the model and HOPPY’s movement within the gantry environment.

### DynaRing: A Patient-Specific Mitral Annuloplasty Ring With Selective Stiffness Segments

I developed a system to test the durability of a new mitral valve ring design that lasts significantly longer than currently available rings; this work was especially meaningful to me because a longer-lasting ring meant that patients did not have to replace their ring as often, thus offering a more affordable and accessible intervention.

## Work on Accessible Technology


### I'm ok because I'm alive" understanding socio-cultural accessibility barriers for refugees with disabilities in the US

I wanted to understand the perspectives of refugees with disabilities on social-cultural barriers that effect their access to medical care.  With this goal, I interviewed community leaders that worked directly with refugees to gain insight on these barrier. I conducted thematic analysis to extract themes on barriers that prevent refugees from accessing the care they need.

### Structural accessibility barriers and service gaps facing refugees with disabilities in the United States

I wanted to understand the perspectives of refugees with disabilities on service-gaps (especially between refugees and healthcare providers) that effect their access to medical care.  With this goal, I interviewed community leaders that worked directly with refugees to gain insight on these barrier. I conducted thematic analysis to extract themes on barriers that prevent refugees from accessing the care they need.

### Fear is Grounded in Reality”: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Refugees’ Access to Health and Accessibility Resources in the United States

With the hardships that hit the US with COVID-19, I wanted to understand the perspectives of refugees with disabilities on the effects of COVID-19 on their access to medical care.  With this goal, I interviewed community leaders that worked directly with refugees to gain insight on these barrier. I conducted thematic analysis to extract themes on barriers that prevent refugees from accessing the care they need during COVID-19.

## 3D Modeling 

### Three-dimensional Visualization of Harvestman Spermathecae using Confocal Microscopy

I used confocal microscopy to develop a non-invasive imaging and 3D-reconstruction method for the sperm storage organ of female arachnids; I developed the first-ever noninvasive imaging method for arachnids and created the first 3D images of their sperm storage organs.
