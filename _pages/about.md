Hello, I'm Annika! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am studying Mechanical Engineering. My research interests include developing the structural design and dynamics of robotic systems which can be applied to the medical and healthcare field.

Currently, I am working as an undergraduate research lab assistant at the RoboDesign Lab under the Mechanical Science & Engineering Department at UIUC. I am also virtually working in Dr. Henny Admoni's Human and Robot Partners Lab and Dr. Zackory Erickson's Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.
