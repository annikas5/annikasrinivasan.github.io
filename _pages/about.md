I am a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Assistant Professor Henny Admoni [HARP Lab](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/) and Assistant Professor Zackory Erickson [RCHI Lab](https://rchi-lab.github.io/). My research focuses on leveraging user input to guide the design of accessible robotic systems, particularly in addressing the needs of the healthcare community and optimizing the design of robotic solutions. 

I recieved my B.S in Computer Engineering from the University of Maryland Baltimore County. During my undergrad I worked in many different areas such as Biology, Participatory Design, Medical Devices and Haptics!
