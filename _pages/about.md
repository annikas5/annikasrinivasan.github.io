My work focuses majority within Human Robotic Interaction! I am a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Assistant Professor Henny Admoni and Assistant Professor Zackory Erickson. My research focuses on leveraging user input to guide the design of accessible robotic systems, particularly in addressing the needs of the healthcare community and optimizing the design of robotic solutions. 

I recieved my B.S in Computer Engineering from the University of Maryland Baltimore County. During my undergrad I worked in many different areas such as Biology, Participatory Design, Medical Devices and Haptics! Check out my work from my undergrad here (add link)!
