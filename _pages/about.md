My work focuses majority within Human Robotic Interaction! I am a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Assistant Professor Henny Admoni and Assistant Professor Zackory Erickson. My research focuses on leveraging user input to guide the design of accessible robotic systems, particularly in addressing the needs of the healthcare community and optimizing the design of robotic solutions.
